RHEL-USB-INSTALLER
==================

(WARNING:  this will delete a drive!!) this script that helps me set up  a USB stick to install RHEL 


This script is not based on my own work, but entirely take from :
http://slashsarc.com/2013/12/make-a-rhel-6-bootable-usb-installer/

Thanks to slashsarc for this work.  I just copied  his stuff into a shell script because I'll probably be messing with my usb installer sticks pretty often.

Also note that at one point the CentOS 6.4 host I was using got fussy about rereading the partition talbes on my usb.  a restart cleared up the problem, but not before I wasted an hour trying to figure out what I had done wrong:)
